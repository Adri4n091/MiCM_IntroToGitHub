# FUNGI

Undertake this project if you do not want to do the data analysis project. Instead, you will look at building a database for bioinformatics tools. Essentially, you will compile links to different tools/articles/resources that are useful for bioinformatics.
## Fungi related databases
- FungiDB (fungidb.org) https://fungidb.org
  - is a free online resource for data mining and functional genomics analysis for fungal and oomycete species.
